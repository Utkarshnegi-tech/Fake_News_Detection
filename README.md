# Fake News Detection

## Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model for detecting fake news articles. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to process and classify news articles as either real or fake. The project is built using Python and leverages key libraries such as **pandas**, **NumPy**, **seaborn**, **matplotlib**, and **scikit-learn** for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Libraries Used

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and handling datasets.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **matplotlib**: For plotting graphs and visualizations.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning model creation and evaluation.
- **re**: For text cleaning and preprocessing.
- **string**: For handling string manipulations.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of news articles labeled as either real or fake. The data is stored in a CSV file with the following columns:

**text**: The content of the news article.
**label**: The label indicating whether the news is "real" or "fake".
You can download the dataset and save it as fake_news_data.csv in the data/ directory.

## Project Workflow
**Data Preprocessing**:
- Load the dataset, clean the text (remove special characters, stopwords, etc.), and normalize the text data.
  
**Feature Engineering**:
- Convert text data into numerical format using techniques like TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words.
  
**Model Training**:
- Split the data into training and test sets. Train machine learning models like Logistic Regression, SVM, or Random Forest on the training set.
  
**Model Evaluation**:
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Results
The model's performance can be evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The confusion matrix can also be used for a more detailed evaluation of how well the model distinguishes between real and fake news.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of detecting fake news articles using machine learning techniques. The key steps involved include text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. The model can be further optimized by experimenting with different algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and additional data preprocessing techniques.

Feel free to modify the project, try different classifiers, or improve the feature extraction techniques to achieve better performance.
